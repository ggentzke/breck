    <h2>Jann, for your gift:</h2>
    <p>
      I would like to help you start your personal website by purchasing your domain and providing
      advice as you need it (code, deployment, etc).  As a new university student and novice engineer,
      the utility of a personal website will steadily increase.  Whether you need a place to serve your
      resume, a profile more personal than LinkedIn, or a repository for <a href="/gaddis">kitteh pictures</a>,
      I hope you find use for this gift.
    </p>

      Your domain name is completely up to you (and the rest of the world that is buying up the good ones).
      I did some quick searching and found jgrovogui.com is available,
      but really you just need to pick anything that sounds right to you. A word of advice: if you think you <i>might</i>
      want a domain in the future that is available now, buy it now.  They're cheap to maintain but always selling
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheers!
